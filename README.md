# UniversityNotesNClEngineering
----
### These notes have been created using LaTeX, a type of programming language for typesetting or making presentable documents. I have used this language to create notes for all of the topics for first year engineering at Newcastle University.
You can fork this repository and link it to your GitHub account to be able to edit and add to your own notes (I suggest you do this as there are some errors) or you can print the notes and annotate to your liking. Getting used to LaTeX will be very useful in research opportunities or further education, such as a Master's or PhD course.
I would suggest using software like Overleaf, which is a free LaTeX editor.
Below are some examples of what your work will look like if you want to edit/change/create your own documents.
